## What are binary trees and what its use?...

   - Binary tree is a tree-type non-linear data structure with a maximum of two children for each parent.

   - Binary trees can be used to store data in a database system, with each node representing a record.

## For the struct we are going to use, Please take a look at the following code.

  - Basic Binary tree:
    ```c
        struct binary_tree_s
        {
            int n;
            struct binary_tree_s *parent;
            struct binary_tree_s *left;
            struct binary_tree_s *right;
        };

        typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
    ```

  - Binary search Tree:
    ```c
        typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
    ```

  - AVL Tree:
    ```c
        typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> we will have to use each type of tree for its specified task. Include all of them inside your header file.
----------------------

## REQUIREMENTS:

   1. Add [This function](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x1C.c/blob/master/binary_tree_print.c) inside your code.

   2. This function is used only for visualization purposes. You donâ€™t have to push it to your repo. It may not be used during the correction.

   3. Your header file name should be `binary_trees.h`.

   4. No global variables allowed.

   5. All the prototypes of your functions should be included inside your header file.
